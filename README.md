It's like creating a big address book for a computer network that keeps everything organized! üñ•Ô∏è
<h2>What You Need</h2>
Microsoft Azure: A place to create virtual computers (called Virtual Machines or VMs).
Remote Desktop: A way to connect to those virtual computers.
Active Directory Domain Services: The tool we‚Äôll set up to manage users and permissions.
PowerShell: A helper tool to automate tasks.
<h2>What We‚Äôre Using</h2>
Windows Server 2022 (for the main computer running the directory).
Windows 10 (for a normal computer connecting to the network).
<h2>What We‚Äôll Do</h2>
Create the virtual computers in Azure.
Make sure they can "talk" to each other.
Install Active Directory and set it up.
Create admin and regular user accounts.
Add a computer to the network.
Allow users to log in remotely.
Add more users to the directory.
<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
Step 1: Create Virtual Computers in Azure
We‚Äôll create two virtual computers:

DC-1 (Domain Controller): Think of this as the boss computer that keeps everything in check.
Client-1: A regular computer that will connect to the boss computer.
Here‚Äôs how it looks:

Step 2: Make Sure They Can Talk to Each Other
We‚Äôll send a ‚Äúping‚Äù from Client-1 to DC-1 (a way for one computer to say, ‚ÄúHi, are you there?‚Äù).
If the ping doesn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôll allow it by turning on a setting in the firewall.

Step 3: Install and Set Up Active Directory
On DC-1, we‚Äôll install Active Directory, which turns it into the "Directory Boss."

We‚Äôll create a domain (like a team name) called myadproject.com.

Step 4: Create Admin and Regular User Accounts
In Active Directory, we‚Äôll:

Create folders (called Organizational Units) to organize users: Admins and Employees.
Add an admin user (e.g., Jane Admin) and give them special permissions.

Step 5: Add Client-1 to the Domain
Client-1 will join the team! This connects it to the domain (myadproject.com), so it follows the boss computer‚Äôs rules.

Step 6: Set Up Remote Desktop for Users
We‚Äôll allow regular users to use Remote Desktop to log in to Client-1.

Step 7: Add More Users with a Script
Instead of adding users one by one, we‚Äôll run a PowerShell script to quickly create lots of users.

These users will be part of the Employees group.
We‚Äôll log in with one of these accounts to make sure it works.

<h2>Clean Up</h2> When you‚Äôre done, don‚Äôt forget to delete everything in Azure to avoid charges!
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2> This walkthrough is a great way to learn about setting up Active Directory and managing a network. It‚Äôs like being the librarian of a big digital library!
